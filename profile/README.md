## Welcome

We started this company to build technology to help athletes and coaches reach
their full potential guided by two main principles:

1. **Human-Centered Approach**: engaging with real coaches, real athletes, and
   real teams to understand their needs and how best to build technology that
   will aid them and never replace them; and

2. **Scientific Approach**: we make use of the latest research in Computer
   Science, Sports Science, and Design to build the best technology possible
   that is useful and enjoyable to use.

## Current Projects

### Training Days
A remote-coaching platform built by incorporating the input of both athletes and
coaches.
